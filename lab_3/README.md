# Chatbot demo with OpenVINO and ChatGLM3

Here is an example of how to deploy ChatGLM3 using OpenVINO.

**chatglm3-6b** - ChatGLM3-6B is the latest open-source model in the ChatGLM series. While retaining many excellent features such as smooth dialogue and low deployment threshold from the previous two generations, ChatGLM3-6B employs a more diverse training dataset, more sufficient training steps, and a more reasonable training strategy. ChatGLM3-6B adopts a newly designed [Prompt format](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3/blob/main/PROMPT_en.md), in addition to the normal multi-turn dialogue.
